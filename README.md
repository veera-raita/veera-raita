- 👋 hi, i’m @veera-raita
- 📝 i'm studying game programming in a university of applied sciences!
- 🕹️ i’m interested in programming for unity games, especially retro-styled (pixel art or psx-style)
- 🌱 i’m currently learning advanced c# and gamedev in unity (according to my uni anyway)
- 🍂 i've also studied a small amount of unreal engine 5 and c++ but it's not my preference
- 👾 trying to use modern tools and game engines for "authentic", pixel perfect retro aesthetics
- 🖥️ avoiding AI - I love programming and I want to learn and do it myself!
- 💫 not looking to collaborate on anything yet; i have my hands full with various projects & classes!
- 📫 how to reach me: message me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veera-raita-9b20742a0/)
